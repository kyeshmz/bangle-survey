For development of the platform, there are 2 options

1. Emulator - https://www.espruino.com/ide/?emulator
2. Development on the device - https://www.espruino.com/ide/

When you want to install the

RAM for dev, Storage for Prod
Flash breaks all the bootloader stuff

memos

vector font bootloader
//decimal values dont work for size
g.setFont("Vector:12",1.5)

g.getFonts()

```
>[
  "4x6",
  "6x8",
  "12x20",
  "6x15",
  "Vector"
 ]
```

this doesnt work g.setFont("12x20:0.5")

g.setFont("8x16"); seems to be the best one for questions because its big enough

## Acceleration data

x is X axis (left-right) in g
y is Y axis (up-down) in g
z is Z axis (in-out) in g
diff is difference between this and the last reading in g
mag is the magnitude of the acceleration in g

```
{ "x": 0.13757324218, "y": 0.34716796875, "z": -0.95874023437, "mag": 1.02889981655,
